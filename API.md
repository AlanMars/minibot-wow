This is the up-to-date list of `MiniBot` custom API, classified into 3 categories according to their lifecycles:

1. Common<br />
The functions that always exist in both GLUE and World.
2. In-World<br />
The functions that only exist in-world.
3. GLUE<br />
The functions that only exist in GLUE screens.

All of the custom API below are registered in a specific global table `wmbapi` if the client is not OEM. Otherwise, the table name becomes `[MACRO]api`, such as "abcapi" if your OEM short name is "abc". Remember to refer back to this from time to time as the API may change in future.

Before diving into the list, last but not least, we **DO NOT** provide intensive support for the API set. Questions such as "hey, what does API XXX mean?" will be ignored. Please help yourself if you decide to utilize them for your own good.

## Common (Arguments)

- `path = GetAppStorageDirectory()`

Gets the base directory path of app storage.

- `path = GetAppDirectory()`

Gets the app base directory path.

- `path = GetWoWDirectory()`

Gets the WoW base directory path.

- `value = GetSystemVar(name)`

Gets the value of the system variable previously set by `SetSystemVar`. **nil** if it does not exist.

- `value = SetSystemVar(name, value)`

Sets a system variable.

The standard Lua environment gets reset after screen switch including **/reload**. All Lua variables get lost because of this. In this way, we provide "System Variables" that allow you to persist information across different screens in the current game session. This is similar as the game "Console Variable", consisting of a name-value pair.

```lua
-- name (string): The name of the system variable.
-- value (string): The value of the system variable.
```

## Common (File)

- `isOrNot = FileExists(path)`

Checks if a file exists.

- `text = ReadFile(path)`

Reads all text from a file.

- `success = WriteFile(path, text[, append])`

Writes all text to a file.

- `isOrNot = DirectoryExists(path)`

Checks if a directory exists.

[Back to Top](#custom-api)

## Common (Memory)

- `value = ReadMemory(module, offset, type)`

Reads a value at a specific memory offset/rva in a specific memory module.

```lua
-- module (string): The name of the memory module. nil for "Wow.exe" aka the main module.
-- offset (number): The offset/rva in the memory module to read.
-- type (number): The type of the value. Check GetValueTypesTable().
-- value (number): The result value. nil if the memory address is not found.
```

Gets the offset of a memory address in a specific module.

```lua
-- module (string): The name of the memory module. nil for "Wow.exe" aka the main module.

Plays a specific sound WAV/MP3 file once.

- `RunScript(name, script)`

Runs a Lua script with a name by engine.

- `SetCustomScript(name, script)`

Adds a custom script (indexed by name) that gets loaded side by side with the engine modules (Primary and Secondary). Notice that such script also gets loaded in GLUE screen.

[Back to Top](#custom-api)

## Common (Network)

- `request = SendHttpRequest(info)`

Sends a HTTP request asynchronously. The API will return immediately after the request is sent without waiting for the response.

```lua
-- The request info.
info = {
  -- string: The request URL.
  Url = "https://www.microsoft.com/",
  -- [OPTIONAL] string: The request method, can be "GET", "POST", "PUT" or "DELETE".
  Method = "POST",
  -- [OPTIONAL] string: The additional request headers.
  Headers = "Content-Type: application/json\r\nX-Custom: test",
  -- [OPTIONAL] string: The request body, only used Method is "POST" or "PUT".
  Body = "{\"test\": 123}",
  -- [OPTIONAL] string: The pinned HTTPs server certificate as a protection for packet sniffing. If provided, the server certificate must match it or the HTTP request would fail with status "INVALID_CERTIFICATE".
  Certificate = "PINNED CERTIFICATE",
  -- [OPTIONAL] function: The callback function when the status of the request is updated.
  Callback = function(request, status) ... end,
}
-- The HTTP request ID if sent successfully, for querying HTTP response later.
request = "abc123"
```

- `status[, response] = ReceiveHttpResponse(request)`

Checks the status and receives the response of an existing HTTP request. The request will be cleared from memory after the API call if the request is done successfully or unsuccessfully.

```lua
-- The HTTP request ID previously sent.
request = "abc123"
-- The current status of the HTTP request, can be:
-- "REQUESTING": The request is still on the way.
-- "REQUEST_FAILED": The request is terminated due to failures.
-- "INVALID_CERTIFICATE": The request is terminated due to invalid HTTPs certificate.
-- "RESPONDING": Downloading response after the request is sent.
-- "RESPONSE_HEADERS_FAILED": The response download is terminated while fetching response headers.
-- "RESPONSE_BODY_FAILED": The response download is terminated while fetching response body.
-- "SUCCESS": The response is received and everything about the HTTP request is done.
status = "CONNECTING"
-- The response data, available if status is "SUCCESS"
response = {
  -- number: The HTTP response status code.
  Code = 200,
  -- string: The HTTP response headers.
  Headers = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK...",
  -- string: The HTTP response body.
  Body = "...",
  -- string: The actual server certificate if the request is HTTPs, which can be used for pinning.
  Certificate = "SERVER CERTIFICATE",
}
```

Given the nature of async programming model, a simple example to send and receive HTTP is given as below, leveraging the callback function.

```lua
wmbapi.SendHttpRequest({
  Url = "https://www.microsoft.com",
  ...
  Callback = function(request, status)
    -- Deal with the current status and response of the HTTP request here.
    if (status == "SUCCESS") then
      local _, response = wmbapi.ReceiveHttpResponse(request);
      print("response body:", response.Body);
    end
  end
});
```

Another example to send and receive HTTP is given as below, leveraging frame updates.

```lua
local http_frame = CreateFrame("FRAME");
local http_request;
http_frame:SetScript("OnUpdate", function()
  if (not http_request) then
    local info = {...}; -- Fill your actual info here.
    http_request = wmbapi.SendHttpRequest(info);
  else
    local http_status, http_response = wmbapi.ReceiveHttpResponse(http_request)
    if (not http_status) then
      -- The HTTP request has been fulfiled.
      http_frame:SetScript("OnUpdate", nil);
      http_frame = nil;
      return;
    end
    -- Deal with the current status and response of the HTTP request here.
    if (http_status == "SUCCESS") then
      print("response body:", http_response.Body);
    end
  end
end);
```

- `connection = ConnectWebsocket(info)`

Connects to a remote websocket server asynchronously. The API will return immediately after the connection is initiated.

```lua
-- The websocket info.
info = {
  -- string: The websocket URL. (Use http(s) instead of ws(s))
  Url = "https://echo.websocket.org",
  -- [OPTIONAL] string: The additional request headers.
  Headers = "Content-Type: application/json\r\nX-Custom: test",
  -- [OPTIONAL] string: The pinned HTTPs server certificate as a protection for packet sniffing. If provided, the server certificate must match it or the websocket connection would fail with status "INVALID_CERTIFICATE".
  Certificate = "PINNED CERTIFICATE",
  -- [OPTIONAL] function: The callback function when the status of the connection is updated, which can be any one of "CONNECTING", "CONNECTION_FAILED", "INVALID_CERTIFICATE", "CONNECTED", "CLOSING", "CLOSED".
  ConnectCallback = function(connection, status) ... end,
  -- [OPTIONAL] function: The callback function when a piece of data is sent over the connection. (Only string data is supported)
  SendCallback = function(connection, data) ... end,
  -- [OPTIONAL] function: The callback function when a piece of data is received over the connection. (Only string data is supported)
  ReceiveCallback = function(connection, data) ... end
}
-- The websocket connection ID if sent successfully.
connection = "abc123"
```

- `success = CloseWebsocket(connection)`

Closes an existing websocket connection.

- `success = SendWebsocketData(connection, data)`

Sends a piece of string data over an existing websocket connection.

Given the nature of async programming model, a simple example to establish a websocket connection, send data, and disconnect it after data is received is given as below.

```lua
wmbapi.ConnectWebsocket({
  Url = "https://echo.websocket.org",
  ...
  ConnectCallback = function(connection, status)
    -- Deal with the current connection status here.
    if (status == "CONNECTED") then
      print("connected!");
      wmbapi.SendWebsocketData(connection, "test data!");
    elseif (status == "CLOSED") then
      print("disconnected!");
    end
  end,
  SendCallback = function(connection, data)
    print("data sent:", data);
  end,
  ReceiveCallback = function(connection, data)
    print("data received:", data);
    wmbapi.CloseWebsocket(connection);
  end
});
